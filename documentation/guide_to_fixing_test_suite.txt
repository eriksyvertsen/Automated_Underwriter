# Guide to Fix Test Suite Issues

The test suite is encountering an issue with MongoDB Memory Server initialization. Follow these steps to diagnose and fix the problems:

## 1. Install Required Dependencies

First, make sure all required dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install mongodb-memory-server@latest --save-dev
```

## 2. Create Test Environment File

Create a `.env.test` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.test
```

Then edit `.env.test` to use the values provided in the test-env file.

## 3. Verify Test Environment Setup

Run the setup verification script:

```bash
npm run test:setup
```

This will verify that MongoDB Memory Server is working correctly and all dependencies are installed.

## 4. Run the Basic Test

Run a simple test to verify Jest is working:

```bash
npm run test:basic
```

This basic test doesn't rely on MongoDB or other external services and should pass.

## 5. Fix MongoDB Memory Server Initialization

If the above steps don't resolve the issue, these are common problems and solutions:

### Issue: MongoDB Memory Server fails to initialize

- Check MongoDB Memory Server version compatibility with your Node.js version
- Verify you have enough system memory
- Check if MongoDB binaries can be downloaded (internet connection/firewall)

Solution:
```bash
# Try with a specific version
npm uninstall mongodb-memory-server
npm install mongodb-memory-server@7.3.0 --save-dev
```

### Issue: Jest cannot find MongoDB Memory Server

This usually happens when the test environment is not properly set up.

Solution:
```bash
# Enable debugging for Jest
NODE_DEBUG=jest npm test

# Or try running Jest with Node options
NODE_OPTIONS=--trace-warnings npm test
```

## 6. Adjust Test Timeout

If the tests are failing due to timeouts, modify the `jest.config.js` to increase the timeout:

```javascript
testTimeout: 60000, // Increase to 60 seconds
```

## 7. Run Individual Test Files

Instead of running all tests at once, run them individually to identify problematic files:

```bash
npx jest tests/basic.test.js
npx jest tests/services/authService.test.js
# etc.
```

## 8. Debugging Strategy

1. Disable the MongoDB setup temporarily
2. Get simple tests passing
3. Re-enable MongoDB with more debugging
4. Fix each test file one by one

## 9. Alternative In-Memory MongoDB Approach

If MongoDB Memory Server continues to cause issues, consider using a mock approach instead:

```javascript
// In setup.js
jest.mock('../../config/db', () => {
  // Mock implementation of database functions
  return {
    getCollection: jest.fn(() => {
      return {
        findOne: jest.fn(),
        insertOne: jest.fn(),
        // etc.
      };
    }),
    // etc.
  };
});
```

Remember to run the tests in sequence rather than parallel if you're having issues with the MongoDB Memory Server.
